    "name": "G.O.B",
    "description": "G.O.B. is the self-absorbed older brother to Michael Bluth and is a main character of Arrested Development. A social peacock, G.O.B. exudes a certain type of showmanship at all times, perhaps best illustrated by his favorite mode of transportation: his trusty Segway. Once a highly respected magician and founder of The Alliance of Magicians, G.O.B. fell from grace when the TV news revealed the secret to his illusion."
